Couldn't find your camera? Here's what you can do:
1. Check to make sure your database for quantization tables is called "QuantizationTables" and is in the working directory.
2. Make sure you're using appropriate, specific keywords. Naming conventions in the database are, unfortunately, not well established. This can make searching difficult if you're not specific.
3. Do you have a new set of quantization tables? They should be placed in a .txt file and placed in the QuantizationTables directory. 
Make sure you name the file appropriately to make it easy to find later. (i.e. "Apple iPhone 5S", not "my iphone")
The tables should be 8x8, one "on top" of the other (16 rows, 8 columns), and individual values should be separated by spaces. See other quantization tables for an example.
