On Linux, this module makes use of the xclip or xsel commands, which should come with the os. Otherwise run "sudo apt-get install xclip" or "sudo apt-get install xsel" (Note: xsel does not always seem to work.)

Otherwise on Linux, you will need the gtk or PyQt4 modules installed

pip install pillow
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install opencv
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install jsonpickle
