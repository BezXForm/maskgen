* Add analysis for cut and added frames.
* Added a new 'change' analysis without ffmpeg.  
** One operation 'TransformDownSample' to use the old technique for comparison. 
* Added the SelectImageFromFrame operation to go from video to single image.  This is the only operation from video to image.  The image to video operation is PasteImageSpliceToFrames.
